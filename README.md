# Express Server Premature Closure Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js Express applications where the server is closed prematurely, leading to unexpected behavior.  The bug involves incorrectly closing the server before the application has finished its tasks.

## Bug Description
The `server.close()` method is called too early in the application's lifecycle, interrupting ongoing requests or processes.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `node server.js`.
3. Observe that the server might not respond correctly to requests or might shut down immediately.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the `server.close()` method is called only after all necessary operations are complete, such as handling signals like SIGINT or SIGTERM.  This ensures a graceful shutdown.
